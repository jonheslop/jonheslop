- 🔭 I’m currently working on modernising [dashboard.pusher.com], it’s a Ruby on Rails app. I’m building out resuable components with [view_component], it’s great. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning lots about Ruby on Rails, I’ve never used it before Pusher.
- 🤔 I’m always on the look out for more Rails resources particularly around Frontend stuff, right now I am using Webpack(er) to compile ES6 and PostCSS.
- 💬 Ask me about… anything!
