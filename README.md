Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on modernising [dashboard.pusher.com], itâ€™s a Ruby on Rails app. Iâ€™m using building out resuable components with [view_component], itâ€™s great. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning lots about Ruby on Rails, Iâ€™ve never used it before Pusher.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m always on the look out for more Rails resources particularly around Frontend stuff, right now I am using Webpack(er) to compile ES6 and PostCSS.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me aboutâ€¦ anything!
